Be warned, it's one of those pretty shitty couches with that stupid bar in the middle of the seats but it folds out into a bed (Caleb Kissel can vouch for how comfy the bed part is). It's not super uncomfortable if you put some pillows on it.

Hey Will,
Great idea with the RSS feed.  I?ll be sure to tap into it later.
One thing though: not sure if you realized but that link is Public-facing.  I?m sure everyone will agree that we don?t want Olin?s major mailing lists  to be public property.
Could you take it offline until you have a chance to fix the anyone-in-the-world-can-view-Olin-mail glitch?
Thanks,
David

Hello friends.

With the advent of http://olin.slack.com , I've decided to finally get done one of my little ideas. I'm generating an RSS feed for the major mailing lists! This is mostly just for the slack channels that are centered around these lists, but if you're interested, currently both helpme and carpe are found at http://loltools.net/listminder/(listname)/rss.xml, so feel free to check em out. And, this email will post in about an hour to the slack channel for carpe! Which is also cool.

Shoot any feedback my way, I'd love to hear what you have to say.

Thanks David. After the trial run of a month, since the adoption of olin.slack.com is lacking, I've gone ahead and taken the service down since it's not getting use outside of the slack channel.

I think there is a meta-discussion to be had based on the fact that while the list's themselves are private, we accept any address that adds themselves to the main lists (carpe/helpme), and if that is the right process given people's concerns about that opening up the archives and making past emails public.

Have a fabulous rest of the summer, friends.

Sup, carpe. I just won an Intel i7-3970x in a raffle. Unfortunately for me, I?m not interested in building a desktop right now. If you?re interested in a stupidly good processor, ping me and we can talk numbers. They typically go for around $1000, and they?re currently sold out on NewEgg.

Let?s get you a niceass computer and me a niceass dinner.

Hey all,

Semi-last call for students who are thinking about taking this OSS!

We need to finalize the number of phones we'll need to acquire for the
class, so especially if you don't have access to an Android phone (but
would like to take this class), let us know now!

Or, it'll be difficult to get you a phone later...

Thanks!

Message-ID: <DA80C3E6C10BE94E8FCACEB239C2FEE4015288FFFBB0@EXVS01.olin.edu>

Hello, 

I am Mitchell Cieminski a staff of one of highly reputable academic institution (FWOCOE) here in Needham, United States, and I am the researcher of wireless networks. I am pleased to get across to you for a very urgent and minorly profitful deal which I believe will profit one of us on completion. I contacted you after a careful thought that you might be capable of handling this silly transaction which is explained below. I would disrespectfully request that you keep the contents of this mail public and ignore the integrity of the information you come by as a result of this mail. I contact you en masse and others are informed of this communication.

The sum of (8.40 Single American Dollars), has been floating as unclaimed since 2014 in my wallet as all efforts to get across the counters of any store who wanted the money have hit the stones. There was this prospective student by name Mr. Albert schumanhofferstadsonson, high school magnate who was based in the U.K, who happens to be one of our friends. On the 15Th of May 2014, Mr. Albert schumanhofferstadsonson,, his mother Annabel, their mutual friend Alexandra Miche, her hairdresser Christian, and their three-doors-down neighbors william and kate all had pizza in the Paris airport while their flight was delayed, talking about their plan for world domination, see the link for unrelated details of a trip to the beach http://www.bedtime.com/html/trip_to_the_beach.htm

The issues at hand is that late Albert Schumanhofferstadsonson did not declare any next of kin/beneficiary in his official papers including the paper work of his purchase of the pizza. What bothers me most is according to the laws of my country at the expiration of 0 years the funds will be revert to the ownership of the airport if nobody applies to claim the funds, Against this scenery, I have all the information needed to claim these funds and I want to present you to my wallet as the beneficiary to the unclaimed cash. There is some risk involved in this matter as I hold the key to a portal to an alternate dimension and we are going to adopt a legitimate method as I have all ability to make you the beneficiary to the funds. 

I send you this mail without a measure of fear as to the consequences, although I know within me that a penny saved is a penny earned and that success and riches occasionally come easy or on a platter of gold. This is the one truth I have learned from my friends from college. Do not betray my confidence. If we can be of one accord, we should act slowly on this. Please ridicule any writing mistakes.
 
I await your prompt reply on this.

Kind regards
Mitchell Cieminski

(for a semester (or ever))

I have a mattress topper. It's sitting outside of EH2NE suite, and it's free. Take it. I don't need it now, and it's hard to store. Pretty comfortable, and I enjoyed it considerably. But now it's your turn.

Subject: [Carpediem] start (or join) some awesome clubs with me
Message-ID: <DA80C3E6C10BE94E8FCACEB239C2FEE4015288FFFC43@EXVS01.olin.edu>

Tl;dr: just read it. It's worth it I promise.

Hey Folks,

Hope you're summer has gone tremendously! As the start of the school year is upon us soon, I'd like to reach out to our community and ask if there is  any interest in helping me start and run these clubs, as I cannot take a full, active roll in all of them given my commitment to other activities this year.

Here's my short list w/ descriptions for what I'd like help with:

Yoga / Meditation Club: This would be more like a group that would meet up at given points in the week to do / learn some very relaxing and stress-relieving exercises including, but not limited to, yoga, meditation, and (if anyone can lead it) tai chi. I would be willing to help lead exercises, but it'd be great to have a partner-in-crime. This is intended to be a very informal, casual, and beginner-friendly group.

Pros: It can promote stress relief in the Olin community, and it's a club that would have minimal expenses. Also, it's not something that requires heavy commitment, more of a come-and-go-as-you-like thing. Also, with a bit of experience anyone can lead a group briefly and in turns.
Cons: Need to find a good place on campus to do this, and it's likely we'll need to move around from venue to venue.

Flute Club: I know there are plenty of flute players on campus who wish they could keep playing flute (or still do play) and as a budding flautist, I think it'd be great to have a community around it! My idea for this group would be to have a weekly casual meetings where we can jam out, or work on playing a simple arrangement. Of course, this would be a group focused towards experienced musicians, but people who are new to flute (i.e. me :D) can probably stick around and absorb the fun too.

Pros: You get to make music because you WANT to, not have to! Also, flute is just so much fun (and so is fluteboxing (not fighting with flutes, but beatboxing)). Also, casualness means it can't take over your life!
Cons: Can't really work on a piece together unless there is some level of commitment. Also, I want club funding to buy a flute-club-special bass flute, but that may not happen.

Lego club: Let's face it - there are days where you wish you could just drop what you're doing, close your laptop, put your tools back in your toolbox, throw your test off to the side, and just play with Legos for hours on end. I think it'd be great to have monthly or even weekly build events where we can come together and work on building something awesome with legos. This can be as casual or formal as people want it to be!

Pros: Study breaks are awesome! Also I'm sure Nick Tatar (not confirmed, just an idea) would like sponsoring this since I hear he's into Legos. Also Legos are the bomb.com.
Cons: Even in bulk, legos are really costly. I don't know if club funding would be enough to purchase an ample amount of legos. We could also do a donate your legos from home. Also, this may require some planning and commitment from the leading team.

Alright that's about it. All that really remains are finding interested/willing people who want to start the clubs with me, finding sponsors, and filling out initial paperwork. As the year progresses, I may take a lesser role in each of these. It all really depends on how things work out this year. Also, I'm going to keep in mind that first years may want a part in this (#passnorecord) so maybe they can help me too. But until then, it'd be great to have folks willing to help me create the clubs to present to the fishies.

Okay I'm done now. Hit me up if you're interested in any/all of these.

Thanks,

Subhash Gubba

Hey, all-

[Passing this on because it seems Olinesque, as it were-a program for smart, ethical, technical people interested in using their skills to have an impact on a larger societal context.]

The Knight-Mozilla Foundations supports ten-month, paid fellowships for people interested in coding and journalism. Here's an excerpt from their 'Who Should Apply':

The Knight-Mozilla Fellowship program is designed to engage people who like to code and bring them-and their varied expertise-into newsrooms. If you have a knack for coding and an interest in contributing your skills to journalistic projects, you are the type of person we are looking for.

There is no "typical" Fellow, and previous Fellows have come from a variety of backgrounds including academia, software engineering, open source coding, and newsroom development. Most of our Fellows did not major in Computer Science, and many had never visited a newsroom before their Fellowship. We are an inclusive program and seek Fellows who reflect the diversity of the communities we serve. Women and other under-represented participants in technology are strongly encouraged to apply.

Applications are due at midnight EDT on August 16th.

Subject: [Carpediem] baseball device/design in fall
Message-ID: <D011455F.99C75%caitrin.lynch@olin.edu>

Hi Oliners, A Needham resident has contacted me looking to connect with one or more students to help him further a baseball-related product he has been working on for several years. He wants help on furthering the design, and then building a prototype, for a laser trip wire device that is a transmitting and receiving unit. It will be used indoors and outdoors. Interested students may be able to connect with an Olin professor with relevant expertise (that would not be me) to get research credit for this activity in the fall, or students could do this on a purely voluntary basis. If interested, please contact me and I can connect you with the person who contacted me. Thanks! Caitrin

Do you like cooking and baking but often find that the kitchen lacks the tools you need?

Finally, after many years - I am reviving the Kitchen club. This was one of the original clubs on campus, and are responsible for all the weird and fancy gadgets you see in the kitchens today.

All items purchased by the kitchen club will be accessible to members only, meaning we will be able to supervise the care and maintenance of these items.

Items available to members will hopefully include:


*         Kitchen-Aid Stand Mixer<http://www.amazon.com/KitchenAid-KP26M1PSL-Professional-Series-6-Quart/dp/B005Z2L3L8/ref=lp_289932_1_7?s=kitchen&ie=UTF8&qid=1407999041&sr=1-7> (We already have the mixer, just need to get the bowl and attachments)

*         Blender<http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00DBQ18GU?tag=thesweethome-20&linkCode=as2> (Used to have 3 working ones - all were destroyed)

*         Kitchen Scale

*         Instant read thermometer (2x - one for meat, one for breads)

*         8" Knife (with whetstone)

*         Sheep's foot Paring Knife

*         Wavy Edge Paring Knife

*         Bread Knife

*         Chinese cleaver

*         Full set of measuring cups, mixing bowls

*         Balloon and French whisks

*         Aluminum baking sheets

*         Pie Pans

*         2 part cake pans

*         Regular muffin tins

*         Rolling pin

*         Loaf Pans

*         Baking Stone

*         Wire Rack

*         Herbs and Spices

I need at least 3 others so let me know!

Hi! I'm driving back to school and would love if someone joined me! I am driving from Philadelphia, so if you can meet me here or are north of me I would gladly pick you up. (Also, I don't know how much room there is for stuff)

Let me know!

Some lines from the beginning of summer is still in there so just scroll to the bottom to see current entries. I'm sure someone like James Nee could get rid of that old stuff :)

Subject: [Carpediem] Stanford Design Challenge: mobility/older adults
Message-ID: <D017AFC4.9A4B9%caitrin.lynch@olin.edu>

Hi various Olin students,

This fall Lynn Stein, Sara Hendren (new design professor) and I would like to work with students on this Stanford Design Challenge about older adults http://longevity3.stanford.edu/designchallenge2015/about/ (challenge topic listed below my name). We have relevant leads and contacts and expertise, and we'd love to support students as much as possible. Ela Ben-Ur (Olin visiting prof) may also be involved, if time permits for her. This is a perfect challenge for Oliners. We could create this as a research opportunity for credit (via our Aging Research Group, see http://aging.olin.edu/) or as a co-curricular, or as something else?whatever works for you. For the co-curricular option, we need to organize that soon as the list is due out soon.

Interested? Let me know, and please share with others who may be interested.

(This could perhaps somehow feed into the Olin-North Hill grant fund, which will have the next round of applications due late fall. See http://www.northhill.org/InnovationFund#.U_I284BdVrw .)

Thanks, Caitrin

---------------------



The 2014-2015 Challenge focuses on solutions to empower mobility among older adults at a personal level by:

 *   Reducing sedentary lifestyles
 *   Encouraging and enabling physical movement and exercise
 *   Reducing barriers and increasing facilitators to mobility in the home and community

This challenge combines two important goals: designing solutions that maximize an individual?s mobility and keeping older adults actually using these solutions in order to achieve real benefits.

Just as another PSA, SuperShuttle is now in Boston, and I think is a great option for Oliners to take advantage of. MUCH cheaper than a cab, better service, and even MORE cheaper if you get it in a group.

Hi carpe,

I'm not going to be at Olin this year and need to find someone to either
buy my loft or take care of it for me. I was just informed that it will get
thrown out if it is not removed from storage by move in. It is a very
beautiful whitewashed loft with a bookshelf, desk, and cup holder. I am
only asking for 50$. I am desperate. It is such a nice loft and I spent
lots of time making it. It would be a shame if it were thrown out.

Message-ID: <CAHT-TTAuCRvi1FT9anS8F-s48g7MXPp0_MMmrC+iWSPcLHdp8g@mail.gmail.com>

Hey everyone,

The Charles River Center is a nonprofit social service agency that has been
providing advocacy and a variety of services to families, children and
adults with developmental disabilities and autism since 1956.

They are hosting a *5K on Sunday, September 28* and we are creating an Olin
team. The race happens in Needham/Wellesley (incredibly close to Olin), and
it's at 11am so you don't even have to wake up super early. Please consider
supporting this organization - I worked with them in high school and
they're awesome.

Registration is here - make sure you sign up for the 5K race and join the
team "Olin College." SERV will reimburse you $5 off your registration fee
once we're back at Olin. This race replaces the Susan G. Komen Race for the
Cure 5K we've done for the past few years. Info here:
http://www.charlesrivercenterroadrace.com/

We're also looking for volunteers at the event if you don't want to
walk/run the race, so let me know if you're interested.

You'll hear more about this through official SERV channels once the
semester begins, but I wanted to get the word out there early.

See you in a few weeks!

Best,
Ari

Subject: [Carpediem] Tickets to Brad Paisley Concert this Saturday
Message-ID: <D01B994B.271E%justin.poh@students.olin.edu>

Hi Carpe,

Sophia and I have 2 tickets to the Brad Paisley concert this Saturday at the Xfinity Center in Mansfield. The tickets are reserved seats in the covered pavilion, section 8, seats S3 and S4.

We can?t go because we?re not in town but if you would like to go, we?d be happy to let you have the tickets for 10 or 20 bucks each or whatever price you think is reasonable. At this point, we?d rather someone enjoy the concert than for them to go to waste.

If you would like them, please let me know by the end of today or latest tomorrow because I would have to overnight the tickets to you in order for you to receive them on time.

Thanks Carpe!

Cheers,
Justin

Subject: [Carpediem] Do you have thoughts about [Olin]?
Message-ID: <DA80C3E6C10BE94E8FCACEB239C2FEE4015485653E69@EXVS01.olin.edu>

tldr: Give me your complaints, your thoughts, your silly research about our favorite school.

Hey folks. As some of you may know, I am currently at Insper in S?o Paulo, Brazil, helping faculty there design a new engineering school. They are (I am) interested in all aspects of Olin, especially in your experiences, things you've noticed, conclusions, and notes about literally anything. From student life to friendships with Babson students to courses to clubs, and everything in between. Let me give you some examples:

Did you ever take a new course? What did you think of it?
Do you think a course needs a serious revision? Why?
Have you noticed patterns of behavior of Olin students? Faculty members? Staff?
Did you ever write something to a friend about how weird Olin is? Share!
Do you ever have conversations with other Olin students about Olin? What did you conclude?
Have you ever sent a survey out to the school? You should send me the results!
Have you ever done a project or a model about something at Olin?
Do you have a reflection that you want to share with me?

Basically, I'm compiling a crazy corpus of data. Anything that gets sent directly to me will be given special attention. I'm theoretically going through all the emails I've ever gotten, but let's be honest, I have over 40407 emails in my archived inbox. To clarify: I REALLY DON'T CARE WHAT YOUR DATA POINT IS ABOUT. I just want to get a better feel for Olin through the eyes of others.

You're the best! If you ever think of something throughout the semester, just shoot it my way and throw [olin] in the subject line. I'll probably send this email again in about a month to remind you!

One more thing: I may read some of the things you say aloud or email them to someone else, but I will not include a name with them. You will have anonymity among the people I share any findings with. :)

Obrigado e abra?os!
mitch

PS. To you survey-senders, you're getting an email sometime this week asking you to share your survey results with me. Just saying.

Hi! I'm driving back to school and would love if someone joined me! I am driving from Philadelphia, so if you can meet me here or are north of me I would gladly pick you up. (Also, I don't know how much room there is for stuff)

Let me know!

Subject: [Carpediem] Off-campus lectures with Gui
Message-ID: <DA80C3E6C10BE94E8FCACEB239C2FEE4015485AEB314@EXVS01.olin.edu>

Hey Carpe,
    As many of you know, Gui Cavalcanti (Olin class of '09) is a beast at just about all things robotics and many things beyond in the mechanical realm. He has offered to hold some off-campus (presumably at Artisan's Asylum) lectures on whatever we want throughout this upcoming school year if we can come together and decide on a couple topics for him to talk about. This is an amazing opportunity as Gui is a very accomplished mechanical engineer, entrepreneur (though he sometimes denies it), blues dancer, mad inventor, and overall person. If nothing else, simply hearing him talk about his life's adventures and outlooks would be a lecture worth attending. 

   So, if you have something you would like to hear Gui talk about, please e-mail me and I will compile a list of popular results. Things he has taught before at Olin with high praise: Blues dancing, mechanical design, good Solidworks practice, financing a startup, and perhaps something else I'm forgetting.

Hope you've all had wonderful summers!

-Myles

Not sure which department to contact. I am hoping to find a student or students interested in making me a cool cargo bike (3 wheels) as I have a vestibular bilateral dysfunction, that is I have trouble balancing on my 2 wheel bike for the past few years. I have 2 bikes and wonder if they could be recycled to make me the 3 wheeler. I used to run the ceramics program at Babson College and had the pleasure of working with talented Olin Students, that I feel sure could do this for me. I would pay for this. I live in Needham too. My phone is 781-454-7442.

Hi Carpe,

The following email had a link for a ?Project Officer? role in a UAV robotics lab in Singapore. It looks really pretty cool and I think many people would be eligible after graduating from Olin.

?Requirement:
Candidates should hold a master/bachelor degree in Mechatronics/Computers/Automations/ Aerodynamics, or other relevant disciplines, with strong experience in development and maintenance of UAVs, programming with MATLAB, good at mechatronic engineering (i.e. mechanical design and embedded systems). Candidates familiar with quad-rotor or the Vicon system and having hands-on experience in UAV system are preferable.?

Just thought I?d pass it on. It sounds cool, but I don?t know much about the program so do your research if you?re interested.

Eric
